# recursion-exercise

Some exercises I did to get familiar with Recursions.

Ex 1:
Fatorial
A recursive method that calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer n
Fibonacci
A recursive method that finds the nth number in the Fibonacci series
Exponentiation
A recursive method that calculates x to the power n, where x and n are both positive integers

Ex 2 (Countdown):
A recursive method called countDown that takes a single positive integer n as parameter and prints the numbers n through 1 followed by ‘BlastOff!’

Ex 3 (Modified Countdown):
Modified countDown method from the previous exercise that prints only even numbers when n is even, and only odd numbers when n is odd.

Ex 4 (Multiples):
A recursive method called multiples to print the first m multiples of a positive integer n

Ex 5 (Write Vertical):
A recursive method called writeVertical that takes that takes a single positive integer n as a parameter and prints the digits of that integer vertically, one per line

Ex 6 (Sum of Squares):
A recursive method called squares that takes that takes a single positive integer n as a parameter and calculates the sum of the squares of all digits 1 through n

Ex 7 (Towers of Hanoi):
A recursive solution to the Towers of Hanoi problem, modified to return the number of moves required to solve the problem for a given number of discs. An experiment was done to prove that the execution time for solving the Towers of Hanoi problem grows as the value of n increases.
